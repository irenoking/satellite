WebGL based viewer for Kepler orbits described by two-line element sets (TLEs).

Go download some `.txt` (TLE) files from  http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp, then run `mangler.py` on them to generate a new data set (it will overwrite `data0.js`)

I place the code in the public domain. Have fun!
